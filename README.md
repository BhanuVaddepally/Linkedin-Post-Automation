AI-Powered LinkedIn Post Automation with Human Approval Loop

This workflow is a smart LinkedIn post automation system that turns a simple topic into a fully published post — but only after your approval.

You start by entering the topic or theme in the chat trigger. The AI agent then generates a well-structured LinkedIn post based on a predefined system message, ensuring the tone, formatting, and style stay consistent with your content strategy.

Once the post is created, it is sent to your email for review. You can either approve it or suggest changes. If you request modifications, the AI refines the post according to your feedback and sends the updated version back for review. This loop continues until you’re satisfied.

When you finally approve the content, the workflow automatically publishes it to LinkedIn — no manual copying or posting required.

This system combines AI-driven content creation with human oversight, giving you both automation and full control over what gets published.
